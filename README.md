# CalculateRoots

a program that gets the coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏 and 𝑐 of a quadratic equation 𝑎𝑥^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0 & calculates and prints its real roots (if they exit) considering the following test 
cases. Quadratic equations may have one or two real roots or no real roots at all. When using the quadratic formula, you should be aware of the following three possibilities. 
**1. Two different real roots - The discriminant (𝑏^2 – 4 𝑎𝑐) is a positive number.
**2. Two real identical roots - The discriminant (𝑏^2 – 4 𝑎𝑐) is equal to 0.
**3. No real root - The discriminant (𝑏^2 – 4 𝑎𝑐) is a negative number.
